# Naloxone-Cost-Utility-Analysis


## Overview
This repository contains the code and data for a study aimed at evaluating the cost-effectiveness of academic detailing outreach on naloxone prescribing for individuals at risk of opioid-related overdoses and deaths. The study utilizes a decision tree integrated with a Markov model to assess the impact of academic detailing outreach. The model used a hypothetical cohort of 21-year-old opioid users who interacted with a provider who received a naloxone-related academic detailing interaction (AD group) compared to a similar cohort who did not receive academic detailing (non-AD group). Results indicate that academic detailing is a cost-effective strategy for addressing the opioid epidemic, offering valuable insights for decision-makers in healthcare policy and practice.
